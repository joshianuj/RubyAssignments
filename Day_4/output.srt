1
0:0:10,500 --> 0:0:13,102 
Sheldon, it's not a great time!

2
0:0:13,104 --> 0:0:14,570 
What do you want?

3
0:0:14,572 --> 0:0:17,806 
Hello to you, too.

4
0:0:17,808 --> 0:0:20,576 
I'm sorry,
but this is important.

5
0:0:20,578 --> 0:0:22,211 
What is it?

6
0:0:22,213 --> 0:0:23,779 
<i>Back to the Future II</i> was

7
0:0:23,781 --> 0:0:26,682 
in the <i>Back to the Future III</i>
case...

8
0:0:26,684 --> 0:0:29,151 
and <i>Back to the Future III</i>
was-- get this--

9
0:0:29,153 --> 0:0:32,321 
in the <i>Back to the Future II</i>
case.

10
0:0:32,764 --> 0:0:34,298 
So?

11
0:0:34,300 --> 0:0:39,436 
So, did you do that, or am I
in the house with an intruder?

12
0:0:40,405 --> 0:0:42,523 
Sheldon, I got to go inside.

13
0:0:42,525 --> 0:0:45,359 
It's getting rough out here.

14
0:0:46,528 --> 0:0:49,446 
You're dodging the question;
I knew it was you.

15
0:0:50,231 --> 0:0:53,33 
(deep rumbling growl)

16
0:0:53,35 --> 0:0:54,385 
What was that?

17
0:0:54,387 --> 0:0:55,903 
What was what?

18
0:0:55,905 --> 0:0:57,321 
This isn't
a very good connection,

19
0:0:57,323 --> 0:1:0,457 
but it sounded like someone
just released a kraken.

20
0:1:1,242 --> 0:1:5,462 
Okay, I'm hanging up now.

21
0:1:5,464 --> 0:1:7,164 
You know there's
no such thing as a...

22
0:1:7,166 --> 0:1:9,917 
(rumbling growl)

23
0:1:9,919 --> 0:1:12,720 
No...!

24
0:1:12,722 --> 0:1:15,506 
Penny... Penny...

25
0:1:15,508 --> 0:1:17,257 
(voice cracking):
Penny...!

26
0:1:17,259 --> 0:1:19,676 
What's the matter?

27
0:1:19,678 --> 0:1:22,712 
Um... well, I was worried

28
0:1:22,714 --> 0:1:25,215 
that you might be
missing Leonard.

29
0:1:26,267 --> 0:1:28,986 
And that might be causing
you to have bad dreams,

30
0:1:28,988 --> 0:1:32,239 
like the kind you'd get if you
watched <i>Clash of the Titans</i>

31
0:1:32,241 --> 0:1:34,491 
right before you went to bed.

32
0:1:35,243 --> 0:1:38,162 
Sweetie, did <i>you</i> have
a bad dream?

33
0:1:39,30 --> 0:1:40,614 
To be honest, I did.

34
0:1:40,616 --> 0:1:41,565 
Aw.

35
0:1:41,567 --> 0:1:42,699 
<i>Back to the Future II</i> was

36
0:1:42,701 --> 0:1:45,919 
in the <i>Back to the</i>
<i>Future III</i> case.

37
0:1:45,921 --> 0:1:48,38 
Leonard did it.

38
0:1:48,40 --> 0:1:49,6 
Good night.

39
0:1:49,8 --> 0:1:50,491 
(stammering): No, wait.

40
0:1:50,493 --> 0:1:53,293 
Perhaps I should sleep here

41
0:1:53,295 --> 0:1:56,113 
so you don't miss
Leonard as much,

42
0:1:56,115 --> 0:1:59,349 
uh, 'cause you're being
kind of a baby about it.

43
0:2:3,805 --> 0:2:6,306 
You know what?
That would make me feel better.

44
0:2:6,308 --> 0:2:8,192 
Thank you.
You're welcome.

45
0:2:12,163 --> 0:2:14,314 
Good night.

56
0:2:45,203 --> 0:2:46,787 
I think you'd be
pleased to hear

57
0:2:46,789 --> 0:2:48,505 
that this morning in
the parking garage,

58
0:2:48,507 --> 0:2:50,323 
I saw this oil
stain on the ground

59
0:2:50,325 --> 0:2:53,527 
that was shaped just like
my ex-girlfriend, Lucy,

60
0:2:53,529 --> 0:2:55,612 
and I didn't get upset at all.

61
0:2:55,614 --> 0:2:57,264 
I'm proud of you.

62
0:2:57,266 --> 0:3:1,51 
Well, you should be,
'cause she was looking good.

63
0:3:1,53 --> 0:3:4,388 
Dear Lord!
You're an astronomer.

64
0:3:4,390 --> 0:3:6,273 
Although you may
have earthly woes,

65
0:3:6,275 --> 0:3:8,592 
get your mind back
on the stars.

66
0:3:8,594 --> 0:3:9,843 
Gee, even the lowly
dung beetle

67
0:3:9,845 --> 0:3:13,213 
chooses to plot its course
by using the Milky Way.

68
0:3:13,215 --> 0:3:14,381 
Is that true?

69
0:3:14,383 --> 0:3:17,184 
Everything I say is true.

70
0:3:17,186 --> 0:3:18,152 
Now, of course,

71
0:3:18,154 --> 0:3:19,520 
the dung beetle also enjoys

72
0:3:19,522 --> 0:3:21,538 
eating feces, living in feces

73
0:3:21,540 --> 0:3:23,857 
and making little
balls out of feces.

74
0:3:23,859 --> 0:3:27,578 
So pick and choose which
aspects of its lifestyle

75
0:3:27,580 --> 0:3:29,546 
you want to embrace.

76
0:3:30,364 --> 0:3:32,49 
Come on,
you can talk to girls now.

77
0:3:32,51 --> 0:3:34,201 
It shouldn't be hard for you
to meet someone new.

78
0:3:34,203 --> 0:3:35,385 
How can I meet someone new

79
0:3:35,387 --> 0:3:38,105 
when everywhere I look,
I see Lucy's face?

80
0:3:38,107 --> 0:3:39,840 
Tell me you don't see her smile

81
0:3:39,842 --> 0:3:43,210 
in the crust
of this chicken pot pie.

82
0:3:43,212 --> 0:3:45,62 
Oh, will you stop it!

83
0:3:49,383 --> 0:3:50,634 
Now, listen to me.

84
0:3:50,636 --> 0:3:51,768 
There's a welcome party

85
0:3:51,770 --> 0:3:52,970 
for incoming post-docs tonight.

86
0:3:52,972 --> 0:3:54,571 
Go to it and meet someone

87
0:3:54,573 --> 0:3:57,824 
who isn't made of grease or pie.

88
0:3:57,826 --> 0:4:1,161 
You think you're so cool
because your wife is a person?

89
0:4:3,565 --> 0:4:5,332 
(sighs)
Look,

90
0:4:5,334 --> 0:4:7,234 
Bernie's at a neuroscience
conference with Amy--

91
0:4:7,236 --> 0:4:8,619 
I'll go with you.

92
0:4:8,621 --> 0:4:9,770 
You would do that for me?
Of course.

93
0:4:9,772 --> 0:4:11,4 
You're my friend.

94
0:4:11,6 --> 0:4:12,372 
I want you to be happy.

95
0:4:12,374 --> 0:4:14,258 
Thanks. Oh, Sheldon,

96
0:4:14,260 --> 0:4:15,792 
since Amy's out of town,
would you like to join us?

97
0:4:15,794 --> 0:4:18,495 
I want you to be happy, too,

98
0:4:18,497 --> 0:4:21,798 
but not enough
to do anything about it.

99
0:4:24,502 --> 0:4:26,253 
Howie, stop.

100
0:4:26,255 --> 0:4:27,354 
I can't talk like that.

101
0:4:27,356 --> 0:4:30,57 
Amy's right here.

102
0:4:30,59 --> 0:4:32,226 
Sheldon, stop.
For the last time,

103
0:4:32,228 --> 0:4:35,445 
I will not bring home bed bugs.

104
0:4:35,447 --> 0:4:36,596 
The hotel's nice.

105
0:4:36,598 --> 0:4:38,315 
There's a pool, a gym--

106
0:4:38,317 --> 0:4:39,933 
the bar looks like fun.

107
0:4:39,935 --> 0:4:43,820 
Because I looked in the bed,
and there are no bugs.

108
0:4:43,822 --> 0:4:45,122 
Aw, I love you, too.

109
0:4:45,124 --> 0:4:47,440 
If I don't talk to you
before you go to sleep,

110
0:4:47,442 --> 0:4:49,409 
I'll meet you in dreamland.

111
0:4:49,411 --> 0:4:50,661 
AMY:
Good night.

112
0:4:50,663 --> 0:4:53,964 
No, I will not consider sleeping
in my garment bag.

113
0:4:57,318 --> 0:5:1,88 
Penny, did you ever wonder
how Starfleet captains...

114
0:5:1,90 --> 0:5:3,273 
No.

115
0:5:5,93 --> 0:5:7,311 
Well, now that I've piqued
your interest,

116
0:5:7,313 --> 0:5:10,264 
welcome to the exciting world
of 3D chess.

117
0:5:10,266 --> 0:5:12,182 
Why don't you just admit

118
0:5:12,184 --> 0:5:13,400 
you only want to play this game

119
0:5:13,402 --> 0:5:14,818 
because you always
play it with Leonard

120
0:5:14,820 --> 0:5:15,936 
and you miss him?

121
0:5:15,938 --> 0:5:19,489 
You overestimate
his significance in my life.

122
0:5:19,491 --> 0:5:20,741 
Oh...

123
0:5:20,743 --> 0:5:22,859 
Do I miss
how he makes a face

124
0:5:22,861 --> 0:5:25,145 
on my toaster waffle
with syrup?

125
0:5:25,147 --> 0:5:26,730 
No.

126
0:5:26,732 --> 0:5:29,32 
Do I miss the way

127
0:5:29,34 --> 0:5:31,952 
he fixes the zipper on my jacket
when it gets stuck?

128
0:5:31,954 --> 0:5:34,37 
(chuckles)
I don't think so.

129
0:5:34,39 --> 0:5:36,89 
Do I miss how
we say "good night"

130
0:5:36,91 --> 0:5:38,542 
to each other through the walls
of our bedroom

131
0:5:38,544 --> 0:5:39,910 
using Morse code?

132
0:5:39,912 --> 0:5:42,95 
(knocking in Morse code)

133
0:5:44,766 --> 0:5:46,183 
Okay, I get it, I get it.

134
0:5:46,185 --> 0:5:48,51 
You are an emotionless robot.

135
0:5:48,53 --> 0:5:50,454 
Well, I try.

136
0:5:50,456 --> 0:5:53,90 
All right, let's just get
this stupid game over with.

137
0:5:53,92 --> 0:5:54,324 
Great. I'll go first.
Okay.

138
0:5:54,326 --> 0:5:56,476 
By the way,
how are you with zippers?

139
0:5:56,477 --> 0:5:57,165 
Why?

140
0:5:57,190 --> 0:5:58,780 
Well, I really need
to go to the bathroom,

141
0:5:58,781 --> 0:6:1,531 
and this one's gone
all cattywampus.

142
0:6:4,152 --> 0:6:7,204 
Wow, your work on
jellyfish neural nets

143
0:6:7,206 --> 0:6:8,555 
sounds so interesting.

144
0:6:8,557 --> 0:6:9,740 
It is.

145
0:6:9,742 --> 0:6:12,542 
You can download my paper
off the university server.

146
0:6:12,544 --> 0:6:14,711 
I will. You can
download my paper

147
0:6:14,713 --> 0:6:17,581 
on the Van Allen Belts from the
university server as well.

148
0:6:17,583 --> 0:6:19,333 
I will.

149
0:6:20,335 --> 0:6:22,502 
All right.

150
0:6:30,94 --> 0:6:31,728 
(clicks tongue)

151
0:6:36,668 --> 0:6:38,235 
How'd it go?

152
0:6:38,237 --> 0:6:40,387 
Well, if you like dry,
factual statements

153
0:6:40,389 --> 0:6:42,489 
interspersed with painful
moments of silence,

154
0:6:42,491 --> 0:6:44,408 
it was bananas.

155
0:6:45,226 --> 0:6:46,677 
Check it out.

156
0:6:46,679 --> 0:6:48,745 
Mrs. Davis from Human
Resources is here.

157
0:6:48,747 --> 0:6:51,398 
She's probably on the lookout
for sexual harassment.

158
0:6:51,400 --> 0:6:52,649 
Oh, great.

159
0:6:52,651 --> 0:6:55,568 
There go my chances
of being sexually harassed.

160
0:6:55,570 --> 0:7:0,340 
I heard her husband left her
for a hot, young undergrad.

161
0:7:0,342 --> 0:7:3,126 
That's so much better
than the old, ugly ones.

162
0:7:7,865 --> 0:7:9,299 
Mr. Wolowitz,

163
0:7:9,301 --> 0:7:10,350 
Dr. Koothrappali.

164
0:7:10,352 --> 0:7:11,768 
Mrs. Davis,
nice to see you.

165
0:7:11,770 --> 0:7:15,422 
You know, I recently read
a fascinating article

166
0:7:15,424 --> 0:7:18,125 
on infidelity among penguins.

167
0:7:18,127 --> 0:7:20,727 
Okay.

168
0:7:20,729 --> 0:7:23,363 
So if the fact
that your husband left you

169
0:7:23,365 --> 0:7:25,265 
makes you feel unattractive,
just remember,

170
0:7:25,267 --> 0:7:28,301 
penguins get cheated on,
and they're adorable.

171
0:7:37,261 --> 0:7:38,445 
(clicks tongue)

172
0:7:41,165 --> 0:7:43,884 
It was better when you
couldn't talk to women.

173
0:7:46,53 --> 0:7:48,221 
I was thinking of going
to the lecture

174
0:7:48,223 --> 0:7:50,123 
on posterior cingulate
cortex lesions

175
0:7:50,125 --> 0:7:52,392 
in the formation
of autobiographical memory.

176
0:7:52,394 --> 0:7:54,344 
Oh, brain lesions
are fascinating.

177
0:7:54,346 --> 0:7:57,431 
Unless they're yours,
then they're a drag.

178
0:7:57,433 --> 0:7:59,966 
To the advancement of science.

179
0:7:59,968 --> 0:8:3,69 
And to the sick and dying
who make it possible.

180
0:8:5,189 --> 0:8:7,324 
This is fun; we never
really get to talk shop

181
0:8:7,326 --> 0:8:8,358 
with Penny around.

182
0:8:8,360 --> 0:8:10,110 
We usually just end up
talking about boys.

183
0:8:10,112 --> 0:8:12,412 
Which is fine,
but it's nice to mix it up

184
0:8:12,414 --> 0:8:14,314 
with a little intellectual
conversation.

185
0:8:14,316 --> 0:8:16,933 
From the two gentlemen
at the bar.

186
0:8:16,935 --> 0:8:18,535 
Oh, my gosh, boys
bought us drinks!

187
0:8:18,537 --> 0:8:21,204 
Boys bought us drinks!
(gibbering happily)

188
0:8:21,206 --> 0:8:23,73 
Thank you, thank you,
thank you so much.

189
0:8:24,459 --> 0:8:26,176 
Be cool.
You be cool!

190
0:8:26,178 --> 0:8:29,262 
Guys are hitting on us, and
not just to get to Penny.

191
0:8:30,248 --> 0:8:32,15 
You're right.

192
0:8:32,17 --> 0:8:33,467 
Thank you.

193
0:8:38,55 --> 0:8:40,257 
Ooh! Bad move.

194
0:8:40,259 --> 0:8:42,425 
Really? Why?

195
0:8:42,427 --> 0:8:45,645 
My queen can now take your rook
from below.

196
0:8:45,647 --> 0:8:47,731 
So that means I lose, right?

197
0:8:47,733 --> 0:8:49,366 
It's over!

198
0:8:49,368 --> 0:8:52,769 
If I make this move...

199
0:8:52,771 --> 0:8:56,289 
but I won't because we're having
too much fun.

200
0:8:57,91 --> 0:8:59,960 
Okay, let's take a break.

201
0:8:59,962 --> 0:9:2,879 
We're all out of alcohol.

202
0:9:2,881 --> 0:9:4,514 
I wasn't going to get alcohol.

203
0:9:4,516 --> 0:9:7,50 
(groans)

204
0:9:9,220 --> 0:9:11,4 
(sighs)

205
0:9:11,6 --> 0:9:12,756 
Gosh, I wonder what
Leonard's doing right now.

206
0:9:12,758 --> 0:9:15,58 
I miss him so much.

207
0:9:15,60 --> 0:9:16,709 
Well, if you'd like,

208
0:9:16,711 --> 0:9:18,94 
we could call him.

209
0:9:18,96 --> 0:9:20,297 
I-I mean that
you could call him.

210
0:9:20,299 --> 0:9:21,598 
As I've explained,

211
0:9:21,600 --> 0:9:23,733 
the absence of my friends
does not cause me pain.

212
0:9:23,735 --> 0:9:25,986 
As rock and roll bad boy,
Paul Simon, once said,

213
0:9:25,988 --> 0:9:27,70 
"I am a rock.

214
0:9:27,72 --> 0:9:29,322 
I am an i-i-i-island."

215
0:9:30,491 --> 0:9:32,292 
I'm calling him.

216
0:9:32,294 --> 0:9:34,160 
Oh, goodie!
Put him on speakerphone!

217
0:9:35,580 --> 0:9:39,82 
(dance music playing)

218
0:9:40,952 --> 0:9:42,586 
(phone vibrating)

219
0:9:42,588 --> 0:9:43,920 
Excuse me, ladies,

220
0:9:43,922 --> 0:9:45,539 
but my pants are buzzing.

221
0:9:45,541 --> 0:9:47,173 
(vibrating continues)

222
0:9:47,925 --> 0:9:50,410 
North Sea, how can I "kelp" you?

223
0:9:52,496 --> 0:9:53,463 
Leonard?

224
0:9:53,465 --> 0:9:54,598 
Penny?

225
0:9:54,600 --> 0:9:55,715 
Hey, it's Penny.

226
0:9:55,717 --> 0:9:56,916 
Everybody say hi to Penny.

227
0:9:56,918 --> 0:9:58,602 
ALL:
Hi, Penny!

228
0:9:58,604 --> 0:10:2,322 
Wow, it sounds like
you're having a good time.

229
0:10:2,324 --> 0:10:5,208 
Best time of my life!

230
0:10:6,811 --> 0:10:9,963 
Isn't it 5:30
in the morning there?

231
0:10:9,965 --> 0:10:11,97 
Is it?

232
0:10:11,99 --> 0:10:13,817 
Hey, everybody,
it's 5:30 in the morning!

233
0:10:13,819 --> 0:10:15,852 
(whooping)

234
0:10:15,854 --> 0:10:17,370 
Uh...

235
0:10:17,372 --> 0:10:19,256 
okay, well,
we were just calling you

236
0:10:19,258 --> 0:10:20,773 
because we were missing you.

237
0:10:20,775 --> 0:10:21,992 
Iceberg!

238
0:10:21,994 --> 0:10:23,76 
Uh-oh, hang on.

239
0:10:23,78 --> 0:10:24,711 
Are you in danger?

240
0:10:24,713 --> 0:10:26,246 
No, it's a drinking game.

241
0:10:26,248 --> 0:10:28,281 
Whenever we see an iceberg,
we take a shot!

242
0:10:28,283 --> 0:10:30,333 
ALL:
Berg! Berg!

243
0:10:30,335 --> 0:10:32,752 
Berg! Berg! Berg! Berg--
(phone cuts off)

244
0:10:33,471 --> 0:10:34,754 
Leonard, Leonard?

245
0:10:34,756 --> 0:10:36,973 
(scoffs)

246
0:10:37,892 --> 0:10:40,594 
I cannot believe we were
missing that jerk.

247
0:10:40,596 --> 0:10:43,413 
<i>You</i> were.

248
0:10:52,103 --> 0:10:53,987 
So what happened?
How'd it go?

249
0:10:53,989 --> 0:10:56,389 
It's fine. I thanked them again
and let them know

250
0:10:56,391 --> 0:10:57,323 
we're not available.

251
0:10:57,325 --> 0:10:59,475 
So I can drink this
without having

252
0:10:59,477 --> 0:11:1,411 
to give up the goodies?

253
0:11:1,413 --> 0:11:2,528 
Yes, it's all cool.

254
0:11:2,530 --> 0:11:5,431 
Although, if you wanted
to talk to one of them,

255
0:11:5,433 --> 0:11:6,749 
no one would blame you.

256
0:11:6,751 --> 0:11:9,535 
And why would no one
blame me?

257
0:11:10,371 --> 0:11:13,823 
I don't know
what I'm saying.

258
0:11:13,825 --> 0:11:16,342 
Well, it sounds
like you're saying

259
0:11:16,344 --> 0:11:18,94 
that I could do better
than Sheldon.

260
0:11:18,96 --> 0:11:20,463 
Boy, these drinks are strong!

261
0:11:21,882 --> 0:11:26,119 
Hoo, mama, I'm gonna be gginhu !

262
0:11:27,438 --> 0:11:29,305 
No, tell me,
I want to know

263
0:11:29,307 --> 0:11:30,890 
what you meant by that.

264
0:11:33,60 --> 0:11:35,395 
I just meant
that you're not married

265
0:11:35,397 --> 0:11:37,313 
and your boyfriend's kind of...

266
0:11:37,315 --> 0:11:39,282 
Sheldon.

267
0:11:39,284 --> 0:11:42,318 
And your husband
is extremely Howard.

268
0:11:42,320 --> 0:11:44,787 
What's your point?

269
0:11:45,873 --> 0:11:47,707 
Sorry.
I have no point.

270
0:11:47,709 --> 0:11:49,191 
That was a stupid thing
to say.

271
0:11:49,193 --> 0:11:51,577 
Can we please just go back
to having a nice time?

272
0:11:51,579 --> 0:11:54,881 
We could, but unfortunately
my brain is lesion-free

273
0:11:54,883 --> 0:11:56,749 
and I remember that
rotten thing

274
0:11:56,751 --> 0:11:59,2 
you just said about
my sweet baboo.

275
0:11:59,4 --> 0:12:0,169 
Come on. I apologize.

276
0:12:0,171 --> 0:12:2,138 
Can we please
just let it go?

277
0:12:3,90 --> 0:12:5,341 
Sure.
Thanks.

278
0:12:7,144 --> 0:12:10,46 
Your husband's weird
and his clothes are ridiculous.

279
0:12:12,483 --> 0:12:13,533 
I can't believe it!

280
0:12:13,535 --> 0:12:14,967 
All this time
I've been doing nothing

281
0:12:14,969 --> 0:12:16,536 
but sit around
and miss that guy.

282
0:12:16,538 --> 0:12:18,187 
And you know what
the worst part is?

283
0:12:18,189 --> 0:12:19,722 
That you're having to process

284
0:12:19,724 --> 0:12:21,824 
your emotional pain
without vodka?

285
0:12:26,747 --> 0:12:28,748 
No.

286
0:12:28,750 --> 0:12:30,833 
Yes.

287
0:12:32,736 --> 0:12:34,737 
But you know what
the second-worst part is?

288
0:12:34,739 --> 0:12:36,289 
He does not miss me at all.

289
0:12:36,291 --> 0:12:39,192 
Allow me to comfort you.

290
0:12:39,194 --> 0:12:42,362 
At least you've got your health.

291
0:12:44,365 --> 0:12:46,983 
Really? Tha-That's it?
That's comforting?

292
0:12:46,985 --> 0:12:51,54 
Um, uh, in a hundred years,

293
0:12:51,56 --> 0:12:54,40 
you'll both be dead
and it won't matter?

294
0:12:54,42 --> 0:12:56,192 
No! Come on!

295
0:12:56,194 --> 0:12:58,978 
You're supposed to say,
"Of course he misses you.

296
0:12:58,980 --> 0:13:1,931 
The only reason he's partying is
to cover up his pain."

297
0:13:1,933 --> 0:13:4,584 
Oh, no, I don't think
that's true at all.

298
0:13:7,104 --> 0:13:8,488 
This is ridiculous.

299
0:13:8,490 --> 0:13:10,990 
Why am I upset just because
he's off having a good time?

300
0:13:10,992 --> 0:13:15,211 
Well... perhaps you're
obsessively picturing him

301
0:13:15,213 --> 0:13:19,549 
engaged in drunken coitus
with another woman.

302
0:13:21,935 --> 0:13:25,571 
Is that it?
Did I get it right?

303
0:13:27,91 --> 0:13:28,174 
Okay, tha-that's great.

304
0:13:28,176 --> 0:13:30,460 
You can stop trying to make me
feel better now.

305
0:13:30,462 --> 0:13:33,229 
Actually, I can't.
Before Leonard left,

306
0:13:33,231 --> 0:13:35,715 
he made me promise
that I'd take care of you.

307
0:13:35,717 --> 0:13:38,101 
He did?
Yes.

308
0:13:38,103 --> 0:13:40,887 
Oh, that's really sweet.

309
0:13:40,889 --> 0:13:42,572 
Plus, if I do a good job,

310
0:13:42,574 --> 0:13:45,425 
he said he'd bring me back
a sailor's cap.

311
0:13:47,327 --> 0:13:49,245 
Now I miss him even more.

312
0:13:49,247 --> 0:13:53,833 
Well, if it's any consolation,
I'm sure Leonard's tormented

313
0:13:53,835 --> 0:13:59,288 
every moment he's away from your
warm embrace and cherry lips.

314
0:14:0,757 --> 0:14:1,724 
Thanks.

315
0:14:1,726 --> 0:14:3,593 
Oh, seriously?

316
0:14:6,196 --> 0:14:8,631 
Uh, excuse me, Mrs. Davis?

317
0:14:8,633 --> 0:14:9,932 
What?

318
0:14:9,934 --> 0:14:12,969 
I'd like to apologize
for being insensitive.

319
0:14:12,971 --> 0:14:16,689 
And for possibly making penguins
seem like jerks,

320
0:14:16,691 --> 0:14:20,193 
'cause 99% of them
are stand-up guys.

321
0:14:20,195 --> 0:14:22,228 
Forget about it.

322
0:14:23,614 --> 0:14:26,749 
You know, you-you and I,
you and I have a lot in common.

323
0:14:26,751 --> 0:14:28,167 
Is that right?

324
0:14:28,169 --> 0:14:29,869 
Oh, yes, I-I, too,

325
0:14:29,871 --> 0:14:32,488 
am in the throes of heartbreak.

326
0:14:32,490 --> 0:14:34,290 
Okay, fine,
I'll tell you about it.

327
0:14:36,910 --> 0:14:41,380 
Here is a hot beverage
to comfort you.

328
0:14:41,382 --> 0:14:43,282 
It's in a to-go cup.

329
0:14:43,284 --> 0:14:45,134 
Make of that
what you will.

330
0:14:46,870 --> 0:14:49,755 
Come on. It's still early.

331
0:14:49,757 --> 0:14:51,140 
Let's do something.

332
0:14:51,142 --> 0:14:56,729 
Well, I have been toying around
with an idea for 4-D chess.

333
0:14:56,731 --> 0:14:58,447 
How about we just talk?

334
0:14:58,449 --> 0:14:59,499 
All right.

335
0:14:59,501 --> 0:15:1,767 
In 4-D chess...
No.

336
0:15:2,936 --> 0:15:5,471 
Come on, let's talk
about our lives.

337
0:15:5,473 --> 0:15:7,356 
Tell me something
about you I don't know.

338
0:15:7,358 --> 0:15:8,774 
Hmm.

339
0:15:10,827 --> 0:15:14,230 
I own nine pairs of pants.

340
0:15:16,66 --> 0:15:18,67 
Okay, that-that's a good start,

341
0:15:18,69 --> 0:15:19,418 
but I was thinking
maybe something

342
0:15:19,420 --> 0:15:20,469 
a little more personal.

343
0:15:20,471 --> 0:15:22,838 
I see.
Hmm.

344
0:15:22,840 --> 0:15:27,243 
I own nine pairs
of underpants.

345
0:15:29,546 --> 0:15:31,314 
How about I go first?

346
0:15:31,316 --> 0:15:34,467 
But I don't want to know
how many underpants you own.

347
0:15:34,469 --> 0:15:36,552 
Although, based on the floor
of your bedroom,

348
0:15:36,554 --> 0:15:38,304 
I'd say it's a thousand.

349
0:15:38,306 --> 0:15:42,808 
Okay, look, here's something
people do not know about me.

350
0:15:42,810 --> 0:15:44,644 
When I first moved out
to L.A.,

351
0:15:44,646 --> 0:15:47,96 
I did a topless scene
in a low-budget horror movie

352
0:15:47,98 --> 0:15:48,698 
about a killer gorilla.

353
0:15:48,700 --> 0:15:51,267 
Ugh! After I did it,
I felt so ashamed.

354
0:15:51,269 --> 0:15:54,437 
Thankfully, that thing
never came out.

355
0:15:54,439 --> 0:15:56,605 
I've seen that.

356
0:15:57,558 --> 0:15:59,659 
Yeah. <i>Serial Apeist.</i>

357
0:15:59,661 --> 0:16:0,860 
(gasps)

358
0:16:2,296 --> 0:16:5,214 
Howard found it online
the day we met you.

359
0:16:5,216 --> 0:16:6,716 
Oh, God...

360
0:16:6,718 --> 0:16:7,783 
And it was literally

361
0:16:7,785 --> 0:16:9,518 
the moment you walked
out the door.

362
0:16:9,520 --> 0:16:11,454 
(sighs)

363
0:16:11,456 --> 0:16:16,58 
But I see the type of personal
revelations you're going for.

364
0:16:16,60 --> 0:16:19,762 
Okay, here's one I thought
I'd take to the grave.

365
0:16:19,764 --> 0:16:21,47 
Okay.

366
0:16:21,49 --> 0:16:23,349 
Hmm.

367
0:16:23,351 --> 0:16:24,734 
A while back,

368
0:16:24,736 --> 0:16:27,937 
YouTube changed
its user interface

369
0:16:27,939 --> 0:16:32,625 
from a star-based rating system
to a thumbs-up rating system.

370
0:16:32,627 --> 0:16:37,647 
I tell people I'm okay with it,
but I'm really not.

371
0:16:42,519 --> 0:16:44,170 
That's your big revelation?

372
0:16:44,172 --> 0:16:46,906 
Yes.

373
0:16:46,908 --> 0:16:49,492 
Whew! I feel ten pounds lighter.

374
0:16:49,494 --> 0:16:51,210 
Okay, you know what?

375
0:16:51,212 --> 0:16:52,228 
I give up.

376
0:16:52,230 --> 0:16:54,246 
I'm going to bed.

377
0:16:55,332 --> 0:16:57,466 
Here's something else
you don't know about me:

378
0:16:57,468 --> 0:16:59,619 
you just hurt my feelings.

379
0:16:59,621 --> 0:17:0,820 
What did I do?

380
0:17:0,822 --> 0:17:2,388 
I opened up and shared something

381
0:17:2,390 --> 0:17:4,106 
deeply upsetting to me,

382
0:17:4,108 --> 0:17:6,275 
and you treated it
as if it were nothing.

383
0:17:6,277 --> 0:17:9,145 
I-I didn't think
it was a big deal.

384
0:17:9,147 --> 0:17:11,981 
It is to me; that's the point.

385
0:17:14,835 --> 0:17:16,519 
Sheldon, you are right.

386
0:17:16,521 --> 0:17:17,603 
I'm really sorry.

387
0:17:17,605 --> 0:17:19,271 
I should've known better.

388
0:17:19,273 --> 0:17:21,107 
Your apology is accepted.

389
0:17:21,109 --> 0:17:23,192 
Thank you.

390
0:17:23,194 --> 0:17:24,493 
How about a hug?

391
0:17:24,495 --> 0:17:25,978 
How about a hearty handshake?

392
0:17:25,980 --> 0:17:27,880 
Come on.

393
0:17:30,867 --> 0:17:32,852 
Now I know how you felt
getting mauled

394
0:17:32,854 --> 0:17:36,88 
by that sex-crazed
gorilla.

395
0:17:51,571 --> 0:17:52,605 
Good night.

396
0:17:52,607 --> 0:17:54,390 
(curt):
Mm-hmm.

397
0:18:0,580 --> 0:18:3,849 
It was rather flattering to have
strangers send us drinks.

398
0:18:3,851 --> 0:18:6,352 
Yeah, that felt nice.

399
0:18:7,888 --> 0:18:10,956 
Maybe tomorrow morning
we put on some hot pants

400
0:18:10,958 --> 0:18:14,160 
and see if we can score us
some free omelets.

401
0:18:15,629 --> 0:18:20,216 
So, hypothetically, if-if we
were to have gone with them,

402
0:18:20,218 --> 0:18:22,168 
which one would you have picked?

403
0:18:24,438 --> 0:18:25,788 
I think I would

404
0:18:25,790 --> 0:18:28,524 
have gone with the short one
with the goofy haircut.

405
0:18:28,526 --> 0:18:30,592 
Oh, good, 'cause I liked
the tall thin one.

406
0:18:30,594 --> 0:18:32,778 
He seemed intelligent,
kind of a loner,

407
0:18:32,780 --> 0:18:35,264 
maybe a little sexually
inexperienced,

408
0:18:35,266 --> 0:18:38,150 
like I'd have to teach
him a thing or two.

409
0:18:38,152 --> 0:18:40,19 
(growls)

410
0:18:40,21 --> 0:18:41,871 
Not my guy.

411
0:18:41,873 --> 0:18:43,823 
I caught him staring
at my rack.

412
0:18:44,725 --> 0:18:46,775 
It'd be nice to be with a man

413
0:18:46,777 --> 0:18:49,545 
who wants to know
what's underneath my cardigan.

414
0:18:49,547 --> 0:18:52,548 
FYI, it's another cardigan.

415
0:18:54,684 --> 0:18:58,20 
Your short sexed-up guy
kind of sounds like Howard.

416
0:18:58,22 --> 0:19:1,290 
Your brainy virgin kind
of sounds like Sheldon.

417
0:19:2,58 --> 0:19:3,893 
Good night.
Night.

418
0:19:6,596 --> 0:19:9,565 
All right, Dr. Koothrappali,
it's been nice talking to you,

419
0:19:9,567 --> 0:19:10,933 
but I need to go home

420
0:19:10,935 --> 0:19:12,67 
and relieve my babysitter.

421
0:19:12,69 --> 0:19:14,320 
Yeah, I can relate
to being a single parent.

422
0:19:14,322 --> 0:19:16,272 
I have a dog.

423
0:19:16,274 --> 0:19:19,108 
Yeah, it's exactly
the same thing.

424
0:19:19,110 --> 0:19:20,409 
Good night.

425
0:19:20,411 --> 0:19:22,77 
Mrs. Davis...

426
0:19:22,79 --> 0:19:24,914 
I, uh, I must confess,

427
0:19:24,916 --> 0:19:26,332 
I came here tonight

428
0:19:26,334 --> 0:19:29,68 
in a futile attempt
to pick up some lonely postdoc,

429
0:19:29,70 --> 0:19:33,305 
but instead I got to connect
with you at a human level.

430
0:19:33,307 --> 0:19:36,75 
That's a much better evening.

431
0:19:36,810 --> 0:19:38,878 
You're a lovely person.

432
0:19:38,880 --> 0:19:40,629 
Are you hitting on me?

433
0:19:40,631 --> 0:19:42,381 
No, no, no, that would be crazy!

434
0:19:42,383 --> 0:19:43,853 
I mean, if I were hitting
on you, you'd know it

435
0:19:43,854 --> 0:19:46,655 
'cause you'd feel uncomfortable
and a little sad for me.

436
0:19:50,924 --> 0:19:52,808 
You're sweet.

437
0:19:53,844 --> 0:19:55,761 
Good night, Dr. Koothrappali.

438
0:19:55,763 --> 0:19:57,863 
Good night.

439
0:19:59,366 --> 0:20:1,584 
Looks like she accepted
your apology.

440
0:20:1,586 --> 0:20:3,285 
And then some.

441
0:20:3,287 --> 0:20:5,371 
I think we had a moment.

442
0:20:5,373 --> 0:20:8,40 
Oh, please, you did not
have a moment.

443
0:20:8,42 --> 0:20:10,242 
Who died and
made you king of moments?

444
0:20:12,579 --> 0:20:15,164 
Okay, fine. Let's say
there was a moment.

445
0:20:15,166 --> 0:20:17,32 
There was.
There wasn't.

446
0:20:17,34 --> 0:20:21,136 
But... But even if there was,
what are you gonna do about it?

447
0:20:21,138 --> 0:20:27,59 
I will slowly seduce her until
she falls helpless into my bed,

448
0:20:27,61 --> 0:20:29,61 
hungry for the pleasure
only I can give her.

449
0:20:29,63 --> 0:20:30,930 
So nothing.
No, not a thing.

450
0:20:38,958 --> 0:20:41,409 
Ah...

451
0:20:41,411 --> 0:20:43,912 
I'm so glad the police
finally caught

452
0:20:43,914 --> 0:20:47,549 
that psychotic
genetically engineered ape.

453
0:20:52,805 --> 0:20:55,23 
That is my girlfriend!
I swear to God!

454
0:20:55,25 --> 0:20:56,558 
(all cheer)

455
0:20:56,560 --> 0:21:0,94 
ALL: Leonard! Leonard!
Leonard! Leonard!

456
0:21:0,613 --> 0:21:1,930 
(gasps, screams)

457
