1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,602
Sheldon, it's not a great time!

2
00:00:12,604 --> 00:00:14,070
What do you want?

3
00:00:14,072 --> 00:00:17,306
Hello to you, too.

4
00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:20,076
I'm sorry,
but this is important.

5
00:00:20,078 --> 00:00:21,711
What is it?

6
00:00:21,713 --> 00:00:23,279
<i>Back to the Future II</i> was

7
00:00:23,281 --> 00:00:26,182
in the <i>Back to the Future III</i>
case...

8
00:00:26,184 --> 00:00:28,651
and <i>Back to the Future III</i>
was-- get this--

9
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:31,821
in the <i>Back to the Future II</i>
case.

10
00:00:32,264 --> 00:00:33,798
So?

11
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,936
So, did you do that, or am I
in the house with an intruder?

12
00:00:39,905 --> 00:00:42,023
Sheldon, I got to go inside.

13
00:00:42,025 --> 00:00:44,859
It's getting rough out here.

14
00:00:46,028 --> 00:00:48,946
You're dodging the question;
I knew it was you.

15
00:00:49,731 --> 00:00:52,533
(deep rumbling growl)

16
00:00:52,535 --> 00:00:53,885
What was that?

17
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,403
What was what?

18
00:00:55,405 --> 00:00:56,821
This isn't
a very good connection,

19
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:59,957
but it sounded like someone
just released a kraken.

20
00:01:00,742 --> 00:01:04,962
Okay, I'm hanging up now.

21
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:06,664
You know there's
no such thing as a...

22
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:09,417
(rumbling growl)

23
00:01:09,419 --> 00:01:12,220
No...!

24
00:01:12,222 --> 00:01:15,006
Penny... Penny...

25
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,757
(voice cracking):
Penny...!

26
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:19,176
What's the matter?

27
00:01:19,178 --> 00:01:22,212
Um... well, I was worried

28
00:01:22,214 --> 00:01:24,715
that you might be
missing Leonard.

29
00:01:25,767 --> 00:01:28,486
And that might be causing
you to have bad dreams,

30
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:31,739
like the kind you'd get if you
watched <i>Clash of the Titans</i>

31
00:01:31,741 --> 00:01:33,991
right before you went to bed.

32
00:01:34,743 --> 00:01:37,662
Sweetie, did <i>you</i> have
a bad dream?

33
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,114
To be honest, I did.

34
00:01:40,116 --> 00:01:41,065
Aw.

35
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:42,199
<i>Back to the Future II</i> was

36
00:01:42,201 --> 00:01:45,419
in the <i>Back to the</i>
<i>Future III</i> case.

37
00:01:45,421 --> 00:01:47,538
Leonard did it.

38
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,506
Good night.

39
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:49,991
(stammering): No, wait.

40
00:01:49,993 --> 00:01:52,793
Perhaps I should sleep here

41
00:01:52,795 --> 00:01:55,613
so you don't miss
Leonard as much,

42
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:58,849
uh, 'cause you're being
kind of a baby about it.

43
00:02:03,305 --> 00:02:05,806
You know what?
That would make me feel better.

44
00:02:05,808 --> 00:02:07,692
Thank you.
You're welcome.

45
00:02:11,663 --> 00:02:13,814

56
00:02:44,703 --> 00:02:46,287
I think you'd be
pleased to hear

57
00:02:46,289 --> 00:02:48,005
that this morning in
the parking garage,

58
00:02:48,007 --> 00:02:49,823
I saw this oil
stain on the ground

59
00:02:49,825 --> 00:02:53,027
that was shaped just like
my ex-girlfriend, Lucy,

60
00:02:53,029 --> 00:02:55,112
and I didn't get upset at all.

61
00:02:55,114 --> 00:02:56,764
I'm proud of you.

62
00:02:56,766 --> 00:03:00,551
Well, you should be,
'cause she was looking good.

63
00:03:00,553 --> 00:03:03,888
Dear Lord!
You're an astronomer.

64
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:05,773
Although you may
have earthly woes,

65
00:03:05,775 --> 00:03:08,092
get your mind back
on the stars.

66
00:03:08,094 --> 00:03:09,343
Gee, even the lowly
dung beetle

67
00:03:09,345 --> 00:03:12,713
chooses to plot its course
by using the Milky Way.

68
00:03:12,715 --> 00:03:13,881
Is that true?

69
00:03:13,883 --> 00:03:16,684
Everything I say is true.

70
00:03:16,686 --> 00:03:17,652
Now, of course,

71
00:03:17,654 --> 00:03:19,020
the dung beetle also enjoys

72
00:03:19,022 --> 00:03:21,038
eating feces, living in feces

73
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,357
and making little
balls out of feces.

74
00:03:23,359 --> 00:03:27,078
So pick and choose which
aspects of its lifestyle

75
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,046
you want to embrace.

76
00:03:29,864 --> 00:03:31,549
Come on,
you can talk to girls now.

77
00:03:31,551 --> 00:03:33,701
It shouldn't be hard for you
to meet someone new.

78
00:03:33,703 --> 00:03:34,885
How can I meet someone new

79
00:03:34,887 --> 00:03:37,605
when everywhere I look,
I see Lucy's face?

80
00:03:37,607 --> 00:03:39,340
Tell me you don't see her smile

81
00:03:39,342 --> 00:03:42,710
in the crust
of this chicken pot pie.

82
00:03:42,712 --> 00:03:44,562
Oh, will you stop it!

83
00:03:48,883 --> 00:03:50,134
Now, listen to me.

84
00:03:50,136 --> 00:03:51,268
There's a welcome party

85
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,470
for incoming post-docs tonight.

86
00:03:52,472 --> 00:03:54,071
Go to it and meet someone

87
00:03:54,073 --> 00:03:57,324
who isn't made of grease or pie.

88
00:03:57,326 --> 00:04:00,661
You think you're so cool
because your wife is a person?

89
00:04:03,065 --> 00:04:04,832
(sighs)
Look,

90
00:04:04,834 --> 00:04:06,734
Bernie's at a neuroscience
conference with Amy--

91
00:04:06,736 --> 00:04:08,119
I'll go with you.

92
00:04:08,121 --> 00:04:09,270
You would do that for me?
Of course.

93
00:04:09,272 --> 00:04:10,504
You're my friend.

94
00:04:10,506 --> 00:04:11,872
I want you to be happy.

95
00:04:11,874 --> 00:04:13,758
Thanks. Oh, Sheldon,

96
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,292
since Amy's out of town,
would you like to join us?

97
00:04:15,294 --> 00:04:17,995
I want you to be happy, too,

98
00:04:17,997 --> 00:04:21,298
but not enough
to do anything about it.

99
00:04:24,002 --> 00:04:25,753
Howie, stop.

100
00:04:25,755 --> 00:04:26,854
I can't talk like that.

101
00:04:26,856 --> 00:04:29,557
Amy's right here.

102
00:04:29,559 --> 00:04:31,726
Sheldon, stop.
For the last time,

103
00:04:31,728 --> 00:04:34,945
I will not bring home bed bugs.

104
00:04:34,947 --> 00:04:36,096
The hotel's nice.

105
00:04:36,098 --> 00:04:37,815
There's a pool, a gym--

106
00:04:37,817 --> 00:04:39,433
the bar looks like fun.

107
00:04:39,435 --> 00:04:43,320
Because I looked in the bed,
and there are no bugs.

108
00:04:43,322 --> 00:04:44,622
Aw, I love you, too.

109
00:04:44,624 --> 00:04:46,940
If I don't talk to you
before you go to sleep,

110
00:04:46,942 --> 00:04:48,909
I'll meet you in dreamland.

111
00:04:48,911 --> 00:04:50,161
AMY:
Good night.

112
00:04:50,163 --> 00:04:53,464
No, I will not consider sleeping
in my garment bag.

113
00:04:56,818 --> 00:05:00,588
Penny, did you ever wonder
how Starfleet captains...

114
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,773
No.

115
00:05:04,593 --> 00:05:06,811
Well, now that I've piqued
your interest,

116
00:05:06,813 --> 00:05:09,764
welcome to the exciting world
of 3D chess.

117
00:05:09,766 --> 00:05:11,682
Why don't you just admit

118
00:05:11,684 --> 00:05:12,900
you only want to play this game

119
00:05:12,902 --> 00:05:14,318
because you always
play it with Leonard

120
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,436
and you miss him?

121
00:05:15,438 --> 00:05:18,989
You overestimate
his significance in my life.

122
00:05:18,991 --> 00:05:20,241
Oh...

123
00:05:20,243 --> 00:05:22,359
Do I miss
how he makes a face

124
00:05:22,361 --> 00:05:24,645
on my toaster waffle
with syrup?

125
00:05:24,647 --> 00:05:26,230
No.

126
00:05:26,232 --> 00:05:28,532
Do I miss the way

127
00:05:28,534 --> 00:05:31,452
he fixes the zipper on my jacket
when it gets stuck?

128
00:05:31,454 --> 00:05:33,537
(chuckles)
I don't think so.

129
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:35,589
Do I miss how
we say "good night"

130
00:05:35,591 --> 00:05:38,042
to each other through the walls
of our bedroom

131
00:05:38,044 --> 00:05:39,410
using Morse code?

132
00:05:39,412 --> 00:05:41,595
(knocking in Morse code)

133
00:05:44,266 --> 00:05:45,683
Okay, I get it, I get it.

134
00:05:45,685 --> 00:05:47,551
You are an emotionless robot.

135
00:05:47,553 --> 00:05:49,954
Well, I try.

136
00:05:49,956 --> 00:05:52,590
All right, let's just get
this stupid game over with.

137
00:05:52,592 --> 00:05:53,824
Great. I'll go first.
Okay.

138
00:05:53,826 --> 00:05:55,976
By the way,
how are you with zippers?

139
00:05:55,977 --> 00:05:56,665
Why?

140
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,280
Well, I really need
to go to the bathroom,

141
00:05:58,281 --> 00:06:01,031
and this one's gone
all cattywampus.

142
00:06:03,652 --> 00:06:06,704
Wow, your work on
jellyfish neural nets

143
00:06:06,706 --> 00:06:08,055
sounds so interesting.

144
00:06:08,057 --> 00:06:09,240
It is.

145
00:06:09,242 --> 00:06:12,042
You can download my paper
off the university server.

146
00:06:12,044 --> 00:06:14,211
I will. You can
download my paper

147
00:06:14,213 --> 00:06:17,081
on the Van Allen Belts from the
university server as well.

148
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:18,833
I will.

149
00:06:19,835 --> 00:06:22,002
All right.

150
00:06:29,594 --> 00:06:31,228
(clicks tongue)

151
00:06:36,168 --> 00:06:37,735
How'd it go?

152
00:06:37,737 --> 00:06:39,887
Well, if you like dry,
factual statements

153
00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:41,989
interspersed with painful
moments of silence,

154
00:06:41,991 --> 00:06:43,908
it was bananas.

155
00:06:44,726 --> 00:06:46,177
Check it out.

156
00:06:46,179 --> 00:06:48,245
Mrs. Davis from Human
Resources is here.

157
00:06:48,247 --> 00:06:50,898
She's probably on the lookout
for sexual harassment.

158
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,149
Oh, great.

159
00:06:52,151 --> 00:06:55,068
There go my chances
of being sexually harassed.

160
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:59,840
I heard her husband left her
for a hot, young undergrad.

161
00:06:59,842 --> 00:07:02,626
That's so much better
than the old, ugly ones.

162
00:07:07,365 --> 00:07:08,799
Mr. Wolowitz,

163
00:07:08,801 --> 00:07:09,850
Dr. Koothrappali.

164
00:07:09,852 --> 00:07:11,268
Mrs. Davis,
nice to see you.

165
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:14,922
You know, I recently read
a fascinating article

166
00:07:14,924 --> 00:07:17,625
on infidelity among penguins.

167
00:07:17,627 --> 00:07:20,227
Okay.

168
00:07:20,229 --> 00:07:22,863
So if the fact
that your husband left you

169
00:07:22,865 --> 00:07:24,765
makes you feel unattractive,
just remember,

170
00:07:24,767 --> 00:07:27,801
penguins get cheated on,
and they're adorable.

171
00:07:36,761 --> 00:07:37,945
(clicks tongue)

172
00:07:40,665 --> 00:07:43,384
It was better when you
couldn't talk to women.

173
00:07:45,553 --> 00:07:47,721
I was thinking of going
to the lecture

174
00:07:47,723 --> 00:07:49,623
on posterior cingulate
cortex lesions

175
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:51,892
in the formation
of autobiographical memory.

176
00:07:51,894 --> 00:07:53,844
Oh, brain lesions
are fascinating.

177
00:07:53,846 --> 00:07:56,931
Unless they're yours,
then they're a drag.

178
00:07:56,933 --> 00:07:59,466
To the advancement of science.

179
00:07:59,468 --> 00:08:02,569
And to the sick and dying
who make it possible.

180
00:08:04,689 --> 00:08:06,824
This is fun; we never
really get to talk shop

181
00:08:06,826 --> 00:08:07,858
with Penny around.

182
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,610
We usually just end up
talking about boys.

183
00:08:09,612 --> 00:08:11,912
Which is fine,
but it's nice to mix it up

184
00:08:11,914 --> 00:08:13,814
with a little intellectual
conversation.

185
00:08:13,816 --> 00:08:16,433
From the two gentlemen
at the bar.

186
00:08:16,435 --> 00:08:18,035
Oh, my gosh, boys
bought us drinks!

187
00:08:18,037 --> 00:08:20,704
Boys bought us drinks!
(gibbering happily)

188
00:08:20,706 --> 00:08:22,573
Thank you, thank you,
thank you so much.

189
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:25,676
Be cool.
You be cool!

190
00:08:25,678 --> 00:08:28,762
Guys are hitting on us, and
not just to get to Penny.

191
00:08:29,748 --> 00:08:31,515
You're right.

192
00:08:31,517 --> 00:08:32,967
Thank you.

193
00:08:37,555 --> 00:08:39,757
Ooh! Bad move.

194
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:41,925
Really? Why?

195
00:08:41,927 --> 00:08:45,145
My queen can now take your rook
from below.

196
00:08:45,147 --> 00:08:47,231
So that means I lose, right?

197
00:08:47,233 --> 00:08:48,866
It's over!

198
00:08:48,868 --> 00:08:52,269
If I make this move...

199
00:08:52,271 --> 00:08:55,789
but I won't because we're having
too much fun.

200
00:08:56,591 --> 00:08:59,460
Okay, let's take a break.

201
00:08:59,462 --> 00:09:02,379
We're all out of alcohol.

202
00:09:02,381 --> 00:09:04,014
I wasn't going to get alcohol.

203
00:09:04,016 --> 00:09:06,550
(groans)

204
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,504
(sighs)

205
00:09:10,506 --> 00:09:12,256
Gosh, I wonder what
Leonard's doing right now.

206
00:09:12,258 --> 00:09:14,558
I miss him so much.

207
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,209
Well, if you'd like,

208
00:09:16,211 --> 00:09:17,594
we could call him.

209
00:09:17,596 --> 00:09:19,797
I-I mean that
you could call him.

210
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:21,098
As I've explained,

211
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,233
the absence of my friends
does not cause me pain.

212
00:09:23,235 --> 00:09:25,486
As rock and roll bad boy,
Paul Simon, once said,

213
00:09:25,488 --> 00:09:26,570
"I am a rock.

214
00:09:26,572 --> 00:09:28,822
I am an i-i-i-island."

215
00:09:29,991 --> 00:09:31,792
I'm calling him.

216
00:09:31,794 --> 00:09:33,660
Oh, goodie!
Put him on speakerphone!

217
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,582
(dance music playing)

218
00:09:40,452 --> 00:09:42,086
(phone vibrating)

219
00:09:42,088 --> 00:09:43,420
Excuse me, ladies,

220
00:09:43,422 --> 00:09:45,039
but my pants are buzzing.

221
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:46,673
(vibrating continues)

222
00:09:47,425 --> 00:09:49,910
North Sea, how can I "kelp" you?

223
00:09:51,996 --> 00:09:52,963
Leonard?

224
00:09:52,965 --> 00:09:54,098
Penny?

225
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,215
Hey, it's Penny.

226
00:09:55,217 --> 00:09:56,416
Everybody say hi to Penny.

227
00:09:56,418 --> 00:09:58,102
ALL:
Hi, Penny!

228
00:09:58,104 --> 00:10:01,822
Wow, it sounds like
you're having a good time.

229
00:10:01,824 --> 00:10:04,708
Best time of my life!

230
00:10:06,311 --> 00:10:09,463
Isn't it 5:30
in the morning there?

231
00:10:09,465 --> 00:10:10,597
Is it?

232
00:10:10,599 --> 00:10:13,317
Hey, everybody,
it's 5:30 in the morning!

233
00:10:13,319 --> 00:10:15,352
(whooping)

234
00:10:15,354 --> 00:10:16,870
Uh...

235
00:10:16,872 --> 00:10:18,756
okay, well,
we were just calling you

236
00:10:18,758 --> 00:10:20,273
because we were missing you.

237
00:10:20,275 --> 00:10:21,492
Iceberg!

238
00:10:21,494 --> 00:10:22,576
Uh-oh, hang on.

239
00:10:22,578 --> 00:10:24,211
Are you in danger?

240
00:10:24,213 --> 00:10:25,746
No, it's a drinking game.

241
00:10:25,748 --> 00:10:27,781
Whenever we see an iceberg,
we take a shot!

242
00:10:27,783 --> 00:10:29,833
ALL:
Berg! Berg!

243
00:10:29,835 --> 00:10:32,252
Berg! Berg! Berg! Berg--
(phone cuts off)

244
00:10:32,971 --> 00:10:34,254
Leonard, Leonard?

245
00:10:34,256 --> 00:10:36,473
(scoffs)

246
00:10:37,392 --> 00:10:40,094
I cannot believe we were
missing that jerk.

247
00:10:40,096 --> 00:10:42,913
<i>You</i> were.

248
00:10:51,603 --> 00:10:53,487
So what happened?
How'd it go?

249
00:10:53,489 --> 00:10:55,889
It's fine. I thanked them again
and let them know

250
00:10:55,891 --> 00:10:56,823
we're not available.

251
00:10:56,825 --> 00:10:58,975
So I can drink this
without having

252
00:10:58,977 --> 00:11:00,911
to give up the goodies?

253
00:11:00,913 --> 00:11:02,028
Yes, it's all cool.

254
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:04,931
Although, if you wanted
to talk to one of them,

255
00:11:04,933 --> 00:11:06,249
no one would blame you.

256
00:11:06,251 --> 00:11:09,035
And why would no one
blame me?

257
00:11:09,871 --> 00:11:13,323
I don't know
what I'm saying.

258
00:11:13,325 --> 00:11:15,842
Well, it sounds
like you're saying

259
00:11:15,844 --> 00:11:17,594
that I could do better
than Sheldon.

260
00:11:17,596 --> 00:11:19,963
Boy, these drinks are strong!

261
00:11:21,382 --> 00:11:25,619
Hoo, mama, I'm gonna be gginhu !

262
00:11:26,938 --> 00:11:28,805
No, tell me,
I want to know

263
00:11:28,807 --> 00:11:30,390
what you meant by that.

264
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,895
I just meant
that you're not married

265
00:11:34,897 --> 00:11:36,813
and your boyfriend's kind of...

266
00:11:36,815 --> 00:11:38,782
Sheldon.

267
00:11:38,784 --> 00:11:41,818
And your husband
is extremely Howard.

268
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,287
What's your point?

269
00:11:45,373 --> 00:11:47,207
Sorry.
I have no point.

270
00:11:47,209 --> 00:11:48,691
That was a stupid thing
to say.

271
00:11:48,693 --> 00:11:51,077
Can we please just go back
to having a nice time?

272
00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:54,381
We could, but unfortunately
my brain is lesion-free

273
00:11:54,383 --> 00:11:56,249
and I remember that
rotten thing

274
00:11:56,251 --> 00:11:58,502
you just said about
my sweet baboo.

275
00:11:58,504 --> 00:11:59,669
Come on. I apologize.

276
00:11:59,671 --> 00:12:01,638
Can we please
just let it go?

277
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,841
Sure.
Thanks.

278
00:12:06,644 --> 00:12:09,546
Your husband's weird
and his clothes are ridiculous.

279
00:12:11,983 --> 00:12:13,033
I can't believe it!

280
00:12:13,035 --> 00:12:14,467
All this time
I've been doing nothing

281
00:12:14,469 --> 00:12:16,036
but sit around
and miss that guy.

282
00:12:16,038 --> 00:12:17,687
And you know what
the worst part is?

283
00:12:17,689 --> 00:12:19,222
That you're having to process

284
00:12:19,224 --> 00:12:21,324
your emotional pain
without vodka?

285
00:12:26,247 --> 00:12:28,248
No.

286
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,333
Yes.

287
00:12:32,236 --> 00:12:34,237
But you know what
the second-worst part is?

288
00:12:34,239 --> 00:12:35,789
He does not miss me at all.

289
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:38,692
Allow me to comfort you.

290
00:12:38,694 --> 00:12:41,862
At least you've got your health.

291
00:12:43,865 --> 00:12:46,483
Really? Tha-That's it?
That's comforting?

292
00:12:46,485 --> 00:12:50,554
Um, uh, in a hundred years,

293
00:12:50,556 --> 00:12:53,540
you'll both be dead
and it won't matter?

294
00:12:53,542 --> 00:12:55,692
No! Come on!

295
00:12:55,694 --> 00:12:58,478
You're supposed to say,
"Of course he misses you.

296
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,431
The only reason he's partying is
to cover up his pain."

297
00:13:01,433 --> 00:13:04,084
Oh, no, I don't think
that's true at all.

298
00:13:06,604 --> 00:13:07,988
This is ridiculous.

299
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:10,490
Why am I upset just because
he's off having a good time?

300
00:13:10,492 --> 00:13:14,711
Well... perhaps you're
obsessively picturing him

301
00:13:14,713 --> 00:13:19,049
engaged in drunken coitus
with another woman.

302
00:13:21,435 --> 00:13:25,071
Is that it?
Did I get it right?

303
00:13:26,591 --> 00:13:27,674
Okay, tha-that's great.

304
00:13:27,676 --> 00:13:29,960
You can stop trying to make me
feel better now.

305
00:13:29,962 --> 00:13:32,729
Actually, I can't.
Before Leonard left,

306
00:13:32,731 --> 00:13:35,215
he made me promise
that I'd take care of you.

307
00:13:35,217 --> 00:13:37,601
He did?
Yes.

308
00:13:37,603 --> 00:13:40,387
Oh, that's really sweet.

309
00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:42,072
Plus, if I do a good job,

310
00:13:42,074 --> 00:13:44,925
he said he'd bring me back
a sailor's cap.

311
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:48,745
Now I miss him even more.

312
00:13:48,747 --> 00:13:53,333
Well, if it's any consolation,
I'm sure Leonard's tormented

313
00:13:53,335 --> 00:13:58,788
every moment he's away from your
warm embrace and cherry lips.

314
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:01,224
Thanks.

315
00:14:01,226 --> 00:14:03,093
Oh, seriously?

316
00:14:05,696 --> 00:14:08,131
Uh, excuse me, Mrs. Davis?

317
00:14:08,133 --> 00:14:09,432
What?

318
00:14:09,434 --> 00:14:12,469
I'd like to apologize
for being insensitive.

319
00:14:12,471 --> 00:14:16,189
And for possibly making penguins
seem like jerks,

320
00:14:16,191 --> 00:14:19,693
'cause 99% of them
are stand-up guys.

321
00:14:19,695 --> 00:14:21,728
Forget about it.

322
00:14:23,114 --> 00:14:26,249
You know, you-you and I,
you and I have a lot in common.

323
00:14:26,251 --> 00:14:27,667
Is that right?

324
00:14:27,669 --> 00:14:29,369
Oh, yes, I-I, too,

325
00:14:29,371 --> 00:14:31,988
am in the throes of heartbreak.

326
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:33,790
Okay, fine,
I'll tell you about it.

327
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:40,880
Here is a hot beverage
to comfort you.

328
00:14:40,882 --> 00:14:42,782
It's in a to-go cup.

329
00:14:42,784 --> 00:14:44,634
Make of that
what you will.

330
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:49,255
Come on. It's still early.

331
00:14:49,257 --> 00:14:50,640
Let's do something.

332
00:14:50,642 --> 00:14:56,229
Well, I have been toying around
with an idea for 4-D chess.

333
00:14:56,231 --> 00:14:57,947
How about we just talk?

334
00:14:57,949 --> 00:14:58,999
All right.

335
00:14:59,001 --> 00:15:01,267
In 4-D chess...
No.

336
00:15:02,436 --> 00:15:04,971
Come on, let's talk
about our lives.

337
00:15:04,973 --> 00:15:06,856
Tell me something
about you I don't know.

338
00:15:06,858 --> 00:15:08,274
Hmm.

339
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:13,730
I own nine pairs of pants.

340
00:15:15,566 --> 00:15:17,567
Okay, that-that's a good start,

341
00:15:17,569 --> 00:15:18,918
but I was thinking
maybe something

342
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,969
a little more personal.

343
00:15:19,971 --> 00:15:22,338
I see.
Hmm.

344
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:26,743
I own nine pairs
of underpants.

345
00:15:29,046 --> 00:15:30,814
How about I go first?

346
00:15:30,816 --> 00:15:33,967
But I don't want to know
how many underpants you own.

347
00:15:33,969 --> 00:15:36,052
Although, based on the floor
of your bedroom,

348
00:15:36,054 --> 00:15:37,804
I'd say it's a thousand.

349
00:15:37,806 --> 00:15:42,308
Okay, look, here's something
people do not know about me.

350
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:44,144
When I first moved out
to L.A.,

351
00:15:44,146 --> 00:15:46,596
I did a topless scene
in a low-budget horror movie

352
00:15:46,598 --> 00:15:48,198
about a killer gorilla.

353
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,767
Ugh! After I did it,
I felt so ashamed.

354
00:15:50,769 --> 00:15:53,937
Thankfully, that thing
never came out.

355
00:15:53,939 --> 00:15:56,105
I've seen that.

356
00:15:57,058 --> 00:15:59,159
Yeah. <i>Serial Apeist.</i>

357
00:15:59,161 --> 00:16:00,360
(gasps)

358
00:16:01,796 --> 00:16:04,714
Howard found it online
the day we met you.

359
00:16:04,716 --> 00:16:06,216
Oh, God...

360
00:16:06,218 --> 00:16:07,283
And it was literally

361
00:16:07,285 --> 00:16:09,018
the moment you walked
out the door.

362
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,954
(sighs)

363
00:16:10,956 --> 00:16:15,558
But I see the type of personal
revelations you're going for.

364
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:19,262
Okay, here's one I thought
I'd take to the grave.

365
00:16:19,264 --> 00:16:20,547
Okay.

366
00:16:20,549 --> 00:16:22,849
Hmm.

367
00:16:22,851 --> 00:16:24,234
A while back,

368
00:16:24,236 --> 00:16:27,437
YouTube changed
its user interface

369
00:16:27,439 --> 00:16:32,125
from a star-based rating system
to a thumbs-up rating system.

370
00:16:32,127 --> 00:16:37,147
I tell people I'm okay with it,
but I'm really not.

371
00:16:42,019 --> 00:16:43,670
That's your big revelation?

372
00:16:43,672 --> 00:16:46,406
Yes.

373
00:16:46,408 --> 00:16:48,992
Whew! I feel ten pounds lighter.

374
00:16:48,994 --> 00:16:50,710
Okay, you know what?

375
00:16:50,712 --> 00:16:51,728
I give up.

376
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:53,746
I'm going to bed.

377
00:16:54,832 --> 00:16:56,966
Here's something else
you don't know about me:

378
00:16:56,968 --> 00:16:59,119
you just hurt my feelings.

379
00:16:59,121 --> 00:17:00,320
What did I do?

380
00:17:00,322 --> 00:17:01,888
I opened up and shared something

381
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,606
deeply upsetting to me,

382
00:17:03,608 --> 00:17:05,775
and you treated it
as if it were nothing.

383
00:17:05,777 --> 00:17:08,645
I-I didn't think
it was a big deal.

384
00:17:08,647 --> 00:17:11,481
It is to me; that's the point.

385
00:17:14,335 --> 00:17:16,019
Sheldon, you are right.

386
00:17:16,021 --> 00:17:17,103
I'm really sorry.

387
00:17:17,105 --> 00:17:18,771
I should've known better.

388
00:17:18,773 --> 00:17:20,607
Your apology is accepted.

389
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:22,692
Thank you.

390
00:17:22,694 --> 00:17:23,993
How about a hug?

391
00:17:23,995 --> 00:17:25,478
How about a hearty handshake?

392
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,380
Come on.

393
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,352
Now I know how you felt
getting mauled

394
00:17:32,354 --> 00:17:35,588
by that sex-crazed
gorilla.

395
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:52,105
Good night.

396
00:17:52,107 --> 00:17:53,890
(curt):
Mm-hmm.

397
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,349
It was rather flattering to have
strangers send us drinks.

398
00:18:03,351 --> 00:18:05,852
Yeah, that felt nice.

399
00:18:07,388 --> 00:18:10,456
Maybe tomorrow morning
we put on some hot pants

400
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:13,660
and see if we can score us
some free omelets.

401
00:18:15,129 --> 00:18:19,716
So, hypothetically, if-if we
were to have gone with them,

402
00:18:19,718 --> 00:18:21,668
which one would you have picked?

403
00:18:23,938 --> 00:18:25,288
I think I would

404
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:28,024
have gone with the short one
with the goofy haircut.

405
00:18:28,026 --> 00:18:30,092
Oh, good, 'cause I liked
the tall thin one.

406
00:18:30,094 --> 00:18:32,278
He seemed intelligent,
kind of a loner,

407
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,764
maybe a little sexually
inexperienced,

408
00:18:34,766 --> 00:18:37,650
like I'd have to teach
him a thing or two.

409
00:18:37,652 --> 00:18:39,519
(growls)

410
00:18:39,521 --> 00:18:41,371
Not my guy.

411
00:18:41,373 --> 00:18:43,323
I caught him staring
at my rack.

412
00:18:44,225 --> 00:18:46,275
It'd be nice to be with a man

413
00:18:46,277 --> 00:18:49,045
who wants to know
what's underneath my cardigan.

414
00:18:49,047 --> 00:18:52,048
FYI, it's another cardigan.

415
00:18:54,184 --> 00:18:57,520
Your short sexed-up guy
kind of sounds like Howard.

416
00:18:57,522 --> 00:19:00,790
Your brainy virgin kind
of sounds like Sheldon.

417
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:03,393
Good night.
Night.

418
00:19:06,096 --> 00:19:09,065
All right, Dr. Koothrappali,
it's been nice talking to you,

419
00:19:09,067 --> 00:19:10,433
but I need to go home

420
00:19:10,435 --> 00:19:11,567
and relieve my babysitter.

421
00:19:11,569 --> 00:19:13,820
Yeah, I can relate
to being a single parent.

422
00:19:13,822 --> 00:19:15,772
I have a dog.

423
00:19:15,774 --> 00:19:18,608
Yeah, it's exactly
the same thing.

424
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:19,909
Good night.

425
00:19:19,911 --> 00:19:21,577
Mrs. Davis...

426
00:19:21,579 --> 00:19:24,414
I, uh, I must confess,

427
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:25,832
I came here tonight

428
00:19:25,834 --> 00:19:28,568
in a futile attempt
to pick up some lonely postdoc,

429
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:32,805
but instead I got to connect
with you at a human level.

430
00:19:32,807 --> 00:19:35,575
That's a much better evening.

431
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:38,378
You're a lovely person.

432
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,129
Are you hitting on me?

433
00:19:40,131 --> 00:19:41,881
No, no, no, that would be crazy!

434
00:19:41,883 --> 00:19:43,353
I mean, if I were hitting
on you, you'd know it

435
00:19:43,354 --> 00:19:46,155
'cause you'd feel uncomfortable
and a little sad for me.

436
00:19:50,424 --> 00:19:52,308
You're sweet.

437
00:19:53,344 --> 00:19:55,261
Good night, Dr. Koothrappali.

438
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:57,363
Good night.

439
00:19:58,866 --> 00:20:01,084
Looks like she accepted
your apology.

440
00:20:01,086 --> 00:20:02,785
And then some.

441
00:20:02,787 --> 00:20:04,871
I think we had a moment.

442
00:20:04,873 --> 00:20:07,540
Oh, please, you did not
have a moment.

443
00:20:07,542 --> 00:20:09,742
Who died and
made you king of moments?

444
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:14,664
Okay, fine. Let's say
there was a moment.

445
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:16,532
There was.
There wasn't.

446
00:20:16,534 --> 00:20:20,636
But... But even if there was,
what are you gonna do about it?

447
00:20:20,638 --> 00:20:26,559
I will slowly seduce her until
she falls helpless into my bed,

448
00:20:26,561 --> 00:20:28,561
hungry for the pleasure
only I can give her.

449
00:20:28,563 --> 00:20:30,430
So nothing.
No, not a thing.

450
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:40,909
Ah...

451
00:20:40,911 --> 00:20:43,412
I'm so glad the police
finally caught

452
00:20:43,414 --> 00:20:47,049
that psychotic
genetically engineered ape.

453
00:20:52,305 --> 00:20:54,523
That is my girlfriend!
I swear to God!

454
00:20:54,525 --> 00:20:56,058
(all cheer)

455
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:59,594
ALL: Leonard! Leonard!
Leonard! Leonard!

456
00:21:00,113 --> 00:21:01,430
(gasps, screams)

457
00:21:01,432 --> 00:21:06,432
